## Objective-C Util
This is a small collection of Objective-C code I like to use in projects.

## Usage
### FACache
This is an NSCache subclass to support a timer after which the cached item is removed. It also supports NSCoding so that it can be saved to disk easily. Just read through the header file.

### UIFunctions, CGFunctions
Just some convenience functions for CoreGraphics and UIKit. Will be expanded later.

### FAPropertyUtil
This scans a class for its properties and returns an FAPropertyInfo object that offers this information in an easily readable format.

### Mish.h
Some #defines to make my life easier.
